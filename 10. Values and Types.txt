10. Values and Types:
In javascript there is no difference between using single quotes and double quotes to represent strings.
var a = 42;
a holds a number type.
var a = "42"
a holds a string type.
Explicit conversion.
a = 42;
a = String(a);
b = Number(a);

In javascript variables donot have type, values have type. 
So a donot have any type the value 42 is of type number.

Implicit conversion:
var a = 42;

console.log(a);

a = a + ""

console.log(a);

You can see a subtle color difference in console number 42 will be blue and string 42 will be black because of their type.

Like final in java we have something called const in javascript ES6.

For example 
const a = 42;
a = 10;

It either silently fails or throws an error depending on the strict mode.
