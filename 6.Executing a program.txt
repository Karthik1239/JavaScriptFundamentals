6.Executing a program:
Talks about executing/running of a javascript program. Explains about how high level language instrutions are converted into low level language. There is a javascript engine that does this conversion.
Talks about the difference between interpreted language vs compiled language.
Compilation has more than one pass through your program.
Example:
a = 2;
2();
In an interpreted langauge, line 1 is run first and then see that line 2 has an error and throw an error.
In a complied language, first pass is not executing the program, its understanding the program. Checking whether the program is valid. So it would flag line2 as problem before ever running line1.

Javascript is a compiled language. Myth:Lot of people think Javascript is an interpreted language.
